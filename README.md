# bestbuyhub
This was the winning place project for BizHacks 2020, one of UBC's biggest hackathons.
It is a project to help solve Best Buy's distribution problem and help reduce their shipping times to same day delivery.

The front page of BestBuy's website is connected to a backend system using NodeJS that is utilizing the Twillio API to send a text to the user every time they order something on the website and choose the specific "option" of BestBuy Hub.
